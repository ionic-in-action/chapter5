This repository contains the code from the chapter 5 example of Ionic in Action. This example app is a Bitcoin market price to currency tracker. It shows the current price of a bitcoin in many different currencies, with historical charts and configuration.

Here are the primary things we do in this chapter.

* Use tabs with individual navigation histories
* Display a chart of Bitcoin price over time
* Refresh the rate using the Ionic Refresher
* Use a popover to display additional content
* Display full market details for a given currency
* Use advanced lists features such as togglers and reordering
